      <p>I had my US visa interview scheduled for 2:00 PM on March 18 at the US Embassy in Kathmandu, but I arrived early with two friends. 
        After leaving my phone and bag with them, I entered the embassy around 12:15 PM. While waiting in line, I met a few other students‚Äîsome were nervous 
        due to low scores and long academic gaps. I wasn‚Äôt too anxious, but during biometric, my sweaty hands caused a slight delay, which annoyed the officer. 
        Still, I moved forward with confidence.<br>

My interview was at counter 7. The officer asked me about my major, and I answered confidently: Computer Science 
with a focus on cybersecurity. I explained how my interest began in grade 10 when my Facebook account was hacked and 
how cybercrime has been rising rapidly. I mentioned my skills with the Rubik's cube and briefly described my high school studies
 in programming languages like C, Java, PHP, and database. When asked about my sponsor, I answered sincerely, 
 but a slight slip in wording may have caused confusion. The officer looked at my DS-160, pulled out a yellow slip, and 
 said, "Sorry, I cannot approve your visa this time." I calmly asked for the reason, and he replied, "Try next time."<br>

Walking out with that yellow slip was heartbreaking. My friends were waiting outside, hopeful like me, 
but I had to break the news. Despite all my preparation, it felt like everything collapsed in a moment. 
That day, approvals seemed rare, and I realized how uncertain the process can be. Still, 
I believe rejection is not the end‚Äîjust a redirection. For many, the U.S. is a dream. For some, a responsibility. 
For me, it‚Äôs both‚Äîand I will try again.<div class="exp-location">üìç US Embassy, Kathmandu</div>

  <h6 class="read-more-text">
    Hello, I‚Äôm Rishi, a passionate and driven Computer Science student with a deep love for learning, building, and transforming hardship into strength.
    I was born in the peaceful hills of Jukena, Arghakhanchi, Nepal. When I was just three years old, my family moved to Chandrauta in search of better opportunities and a more secure future.<br><br>

    However, life soon tested us in unimaginable ways. In Bhadra 2064 B.S., during the Nepali festival of Teej, my family faced a devastating tragedy. While I, my mother, 
    and my sister were celebrating the festival at our maternal grandparents‚Äô house, our home in Chandrauta was attacked and burned. In that cruel act of arson, my father was burned alive, 
    and our entire home and belongings were reduced to ashes. We lost not only a home but the heart of our family.<span class="dots">...</span>

    <label for="read-more-toggle" class="read-more-btn show-less-inline"></label><br><br>

    <span class="more-content">
      After that, life became a battle of survival. My mother, with no husband and no resources, found the strength to rise. She worked relentlessly to give me and my sister a life filled with hope, 
      education, and dignity. Her strength became the foundation of my character, and her sacrifices became the fuel behind every step I take. My elder sister is now married, and I continue to push forward 
      with a sense of responsibility and purpose ‚Äî to honor my mother‚Äôs struggles and build a future that reflects the values she instilled in me.<br><br>

      Today, I‚Äôm a self-taught developer and technology enthusiast who sees code not just as logic but as a tool to solve problems and express ideas. I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build beautiful 
      and responsive websites. I enjoy building tools like voice assistants using Python and integrating APIs to make practical, usable projects. Every project I create is built with purpose ‚Äî and shaped by the real-life 
      resilience I‚Äôve grown up with.<br><br>

      I‚Äôve always believed that nothing meaningful comes easy. My background has taught me to value effort, honesty, and clarity. I‚Äôve learned to build things from scratch ‚Äî not just in code, but in life. Each project, each challenge, 
      and each success reflects my journey from loss to learning, from pain to purpose. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer and use my abilities to create impactful, efficient, and meaningful technology. 
      I want to build a life of dignity not only for myself but to give back to the woman who gave me everything.<br><br>

      <p>Going beyond limits is the journey of defying boundaries‚Äîwritten by circumstance or doubt. It‚Äôs the drive to reach further when others stop, 
        to rise when it's easier to stay down. 
        It‚Äôs a mindset that refuses to settle, constantly chasing what lies on the other side of ordinary.</div>
